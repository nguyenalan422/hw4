Question 6:
Review the code below and answer the following two questions:
1. Does the change inside increment_int_a change the variable a after the function call?
No, the change inside increment_int_a does not change the variable a after the function call. This is due to the fact that, integers being immutable, meaning that when a user passes an integer into a function, the function only 
gets a copy of the value of the integer, so increment_int_a does not change.

2. Does the change inside increment_int_b change the variable b after the function call?
Yes, because in the code, 'b' is considered the dictionary, which are mutable, so it will pass as a reference of the same object.

3. If they differ answer why? if not why not?
They differ because for integers are inmutable whereas dictionaries are mutable.
