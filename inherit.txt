Question 5: Why do we use inheritance? 
1. One reason we use inheritance is because of code reusability. This allows users
to build brand new classes which can inherit (take) some aspects, in this case existing class's attributes.

2. Another reason why we use inheritance is because it is a great representation of hiearchy. As an example, you can make a class 
called shoes, and the subclasses can be examples such as "Nikes" , "Jordans", or  "Adidas". This means that Shoes is the base class
and the brands are derived from Shoes.
